# Introduction to Data Science: Data Analysis and Prediction Algorithms with R - Rafael A. Irizarry
I've been solving all of the problems in the online version of the book "Introduction to Data Science: Data Analysis and Prediction Algorithms with R" - Rafael A. Irizarry 
<br> You're able to read the online version of book: https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/ or buy one https://leanpub.com/datasciencebook
<br> All my solutions are provided after finishing reading this book at the first time. So you will encounter the case I use the skills of later lessons to solve the problems of the previous lessons
